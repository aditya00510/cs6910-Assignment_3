The wandb report link is:

1. Question 1
    1. Here we have created a class seq2seq, in this class we have created a function "create_model" which will return a model based on different parameters which are passed to seq2seq class.
    2. We have written our code as per the requirements which is asked in the question

2. Question 2
    1. In this question, we have setup the sweep on the above code.
    2. Here we are adding the parameters like Dropout,Batch size,Epochs,Encoder_layer_size,Decoder_layer_size,Emebdding size, Cell type, and latent dimension size.
    3. Then we have run the sweep in wandb.

3. Question 4
    1. Here we have run the model on the parameters on which we are getting highest accuracy. We got an accuracy of 35.35% accuracy on the unseen test data.
    2. Then we have taken 30 images from test data and plotted the images with their predicted label in wandb, which is added to the report.
    3. Then we have have plotted the 32 kernal filters of first layer of the best model. We have plotted all the 32 kernels in 4\*8 grid in wandb.

 4. Question 5
    1. Here we have implemented the attention mechanism and ran sweep over the code.
    2. We got test accuracy as 46.058% with our best model 
    3. We have added the heatmap images in 3\*3 grid to the report.
